# Hibernate
This Repository contains examples of hibernate learnings from Jspiders institute.
Points to Ponder:
1. We need to manually put hibernate.cfg.xml file in src directory.
2. We need to create a lib folder to add hibernate libararies (jars) to our project and then add these jars to our project build path.
